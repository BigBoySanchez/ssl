# These args will be passed to sweep_runner.py by the user when initializing the sweep agent or handled via command arguments 
# BUT sweep_runner.py must accept them.
# The sweep configuration in W&B usually passes parameters as --param value.
# sweep_runner.py is designed to read them from wandb.config, not necessarily command line args for params.
# However, the 'program' (sweep_runner.py) is called by W&B agent.
# W&B agent usually calls `program` and may pass params as args if configured to do so, 
# but simply using `wandb.init()` inside the script grabs the config from the agent process.
# So this config file is correct.
